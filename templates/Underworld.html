    Hades kidnapped Persephone and forces her to stay in the Underworld <br>
    for four months out of the year, which causes winter. <br>
    She only has to come back because she eats 4 pomegranate <br>
    seeds each time, representing the four months she must stay. <br>
    Find and take Hades' stash of pomegranate seeds so Persephone <br>
    can return to Earth and has no reason to overthrow Hades. <br>
